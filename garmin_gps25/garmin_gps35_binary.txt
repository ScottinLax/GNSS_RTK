The GPS35 PC does not implement both of the serial ports.  The raw data is
available on port 2 which is not brought out to the DB-9 connector.  Here is
a little-known fact that may be a solution for your application:  You can
swap the ports under software control.

If you send the following sentence to RXD1 when the port is sending out NMEA
0183 data, the unit will swap ports 1 and 2, effectively replacing port 1
with port 2:

$PGRMO,,S<CR><LF>             where <CR><LF> are the two ASCII characters
for carriage return and linefeed, respectively (0x0D,0x0A)

If you wish to swap the ports back so that you can hear NMEA 0183 data
again, send the following hexadecimal sequence to RXD1:

10 0D 04 02 0D 00 00 E0 10 03

You can also swap the ports back by cycling power to the unit.  It always
comes up with RXD1 and TXD1 set to port 1.

You can download the tech specs for the GPS35 LP series products from the
following location:

http://www.garmin.com/main/spec35.pdf

While this spec was not written for the GPS35PC, appendix C of this document
accurately describes the raw data formats that would appear at TXD1 once you
swapped ports 1 and 2 with the PGRMO sentence described above.

The GPS35PC only implements 4 signals:
RXD1
TXD1
VIN
GND

It does not implement the other 4 signals available on the GPS35 LP series
products:
RXD2
TXD2
PWR_DN
PPS

The GPS35PC's internal design is identical to the GPS35-HVS.  It just has a
different cable coming out of the receiver body.  The main advantage of the
GPS35PC is that it already has common connectors attached.  The GPS35-HVS is
terminated in 8 tinned, stripped wires to which you may add your own
connectors.
